# Sift Science Web Developer Take Home

We're absolutely thrilled to have you interviewing at Sift Science! The purpose
of this exercise is to get a good view on your technical skills and see how you
attack problems. We focus more on best practices, how you structure your code
and how you solve problems.


## Goal

#### Problems to solve:
- Finish the panel navigation so when a user clicks on a different product tab
  the corresponding product panel appears.

- Finish the Enterprise-grade panel. You'll find the designs in the [marketing-assets](https://github.com/SiftScience/web-dev-exercise/tree/master/marketing-assets) folder.
  Font color is: `#416d81` and gray background is: `#f1f1f1`

- Make the webpage responsive. Can a user access the same content on their phone? How do you maintain usability on a smaller screen?


#### Things to get right:

**HTML**

- Semantics
- Structure

**CSS**
- CSS (Or any preprocessor if you choose to add one) architecture
- Use of css specificity
- Readable, maintable code. I.e. modularity, semantic name choices (i.e. **not** `this-box`)
- Support for IE11. Feel free to use flexbox, but please also provide a fallback. For the sake of this exercise, let's use fallbacks with [@supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports).

**Javascript**
- Code structure
- Event Bindings / Delegations

#### Restrictions:
Please refrain from using css frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation. You're welcome to use any other tools to aid you, though it is **not required**.

#### How to submit

Once you are satisfied with your work please be sure to `commit` your work. Zip
up the project folder and send it to us as an email with your project.
